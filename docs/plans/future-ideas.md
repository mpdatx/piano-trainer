# Future Ideas

## Trainer Modes (Interactive Practice)

### Chord Identification (ear training)
- Hear a chord, identify it (major/minor/dim/aug/7th)
- Button-grid answers, same pattern as Interval trainer
- Progressive levels: major vs minor triads → add dim/aug → add 7th chords
- Reinforces chapters 10-11 and 17

### Chord Building
- See a chord symbol (e.g., "Dm7") → play the correct notes on the keyboard
- New mechanic: accept multiple simultaneous key presses as one answer
- Progressive levels: major triads → minor triads → 7th chords → inversions
- Most piano-specific trainer idea

### Scale Practice
- See a scale name (e.g., "G major") → play the notes in order on the keyboard
- Sequential input: user plays each note one at a time, in order
- Progressive levels: C major → other major keys → minor scales → modes

### Sight Reading (multi-note)
- See a short phrase (2-4 notes) on the staff → play them in order
- Steps up from single-note reading to sequential reading
- Progressive levels: stepwise motion → skips → longer phrases

### Rhythm Tapping
- See a rhythm pattern → tap/click in time
- Totally new mechanic (timing-based rather than pitch-based)
- Would need a metronome/click track

## Lesson Chapters (Tier 4+)

### Tier 4 Ideas
- Diminished & augmented chords
- Chord inversions in depth (all positions, voice leading)
- Common progressions (12-bar blues, ii-V-I jazz turnaround)

### Tier 5 Ideas
- Ornaments (trills, mordents, turns, grace notes)
- Pedal markings (sustain, sostenuto, una corda)
- Musical form (AABA, verse-chorus, binary, ternary, rondo)
